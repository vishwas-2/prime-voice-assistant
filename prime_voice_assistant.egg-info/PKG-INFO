# PRIME Voice Assistant

**Proactive Reasoning Intelligent Machine Entity**

PRIME is an advanced AI voice assistant designed for CLI/terminal environments. It provides natural voice interaction, system control capabilities, screen reading, memory management, and proactive assistance while maintaining strict safety protocols.

## Features

- 🎤 **Natural Voice Interaction**: Speak naturally to control your system
- 🧠 **Context Awareness**: Remembers conversation history and user preferences
- 🔒 **Safety First**: Confirms destructive actions before execution
- 📝 **Notes & Reminders**: Voice-activated note-taking and reminders
- 🤖 **Task Automation**: Record and replay action sequences
- 👁️ **Screen Reading**: OCR-based screen content interpretation
- 🔧 **System Control**: Manage applications, processes, and settings
- 🚀 **Proactive Assistance**: Suggests improvements and automation opportunities

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.9 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux

### System Dependencies

#### macOS
```bash
brew install portaudio tesseract
```

#### Ubuntu/Debian
```bash
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python3-pyaudio tesseract-ocr
```

#### Windows
- Install [Tesseract OCR](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki)
- PyAudio wheels available via pip

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository** (or download the source code)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/prime-voice-assistant.git
cd prime-voice-assistant
```

2. **Create a virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**

On macOS/Linux:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:
```bash
venv\Scripts\activate
```

4. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. **Install PRIME in development mode**
```bash
pip install -e .
```

6. **Download spaCy language model**
```bash
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

## Quick Start

### Running PRIME

```bash
prime
```

### Configuration

PRIME stores configuration and data in `~/.prime/`:
- `~/.prime/logs/` - Log files
- `~/.prime/data/` - User preferences and session history
- `~/.prime/config/` - Configuration files

### Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
# Logging
PRIME_LOG_LEVEL=INFO

# Voice settings
PRIME_VOICE_ENABLED=true
PRIME_VOICE_PROFILE=default

# Safety settings
PRIME_REQUIRE_CONFIRMATION=true
```

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=prime --cov-report=html

# Run only unit tests
pytest tests/unit/

# Run only property-based tests
pytest tests/property/
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format code with black
black prime/ tests/

# Check code style
flake8 prime/ tests/

# Type checking
mypy prime/
```

## Usage Examples

### Voice Commands

```
"PRIME, open Firefox"
"What's on my screen?"
"Create a note: Meeting at 3pm tomorrow"
"Show me running processes"
"Adjust volume to 50%"
"Remind me to call John in 2 hours"
```

### Text Mode

PRIME also supports text input for situations where voice is not practical:

```bash
prime --text-only
```

## Safety Features

PRIME includes comprehensive safety controls:

- ✅ Confirmation required for destructive actions (file deletion, system shutdown, etc.)
- ✅ Prohibited operations blocked (hacking, security bypass, etc.)
- ✅ Encrypted storage for sensitive data
- ✅ Local processing (no data sent to external servers)
- ✅ Detailed logging for audit trails
